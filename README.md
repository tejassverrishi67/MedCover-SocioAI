# MedCover-SocioAI

MedCover-SocioAI is a **student-built AI-powered decision-support tool** designed to help people in India understand **suitable health insurance options and government health schemes** based on their personal, financial, and medical context.

The project focuses on **clarity, accessibility, and explainability**, especially for users who find healthcare policies confusing or overwhelming.

## Problem Statement

In India, many individuals struggle to understand:

- Which health insurance options are suitable for their personal situation  
- Whether they are eligible for government health schemes  
- The trade-offs between private insurance, public healthcare, and hybrid approaches  

This problem is especially common among:
- Low-income families  
- Young earners  
- People with existing or chronic medical conditions  

Making the wrong healthcare coverage decision can lead to **serious financial stress**, delayed treatment, or lack of access to care. Most existing platforms focus on selling insurance rather than **helping users understand their real options**.

## What We Built

MedCover-SocioAI is a **web-based AI system** that helps users make sense of healthcare coverage options in a **non-promotional and explainable** way.

The system:
- Collects basic user details such as:
  - Age  
  - Income  
  - Location  
  - Medical history  
  - Number of dependents  
- Analyzes these details **together**, not in isolation  
- Generates **context-aware explanations** instead of fixed rule-based outputs  

It provides:
- Government health scheme suggestions  
- Private insurance possibilities  
- Hybrid approaches (e.g., employer coverage + add-ons)  
- Clear explanations of:
  - Why an option may suit the user  
  - What trade-offs or limitations exist  

The goal is **not to sell insurance**, but to help users **understand their choices** so they can make informed decisions.

## How Artificial Intelligence Is Used

AI is used to move beyond simple IF–ELSE rules and perform **contextual reasoning**.

The system uses AI to:
- Interpret financial, medical, and household data together  
- Compare the user’s profile with common real-world healthcare scenarios in India  
- Generate **explainable reasoning**, such as:
  - Why a government scheme may be safer than private insurance in certain cases  
  - Why private insurance may involve higher risk, cost, or waiting periods  
  - What risks or exclusions the user should be aware of  

### Context-Aware Chatbot
- A built-in chatbot answers follow-up questions  
- It remembers the user’s previously provided details  
- Responses stay aligned with the user’s specific situation  

This makes the system interactive, understandable, and user-friendly.

## Social Impact

- Improve awareness of public healthcare schemes in India  
- Reduce poor financial decisions caused by misunderstanding insurance policies  
- Support people with limited income or chronic health conditions  
- Make healthcare information **simpler and more accessible**  

The project follows the principle of **AI for Social Impact**, prioritizing transparency, accessibility, and user understanding over commercial interests.
