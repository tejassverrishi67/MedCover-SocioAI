# MedCover-SocioAI

MedCover-SocioAI is a **student-built AI-powered web tool** designed to help users understand suitable health coverage options and government health schemes in India.

The project focuses on **clarity, accessibility, and explainability**, especially for users who find healthcare policies confusing or difficult to compare.

## 🩺 Problem Statement

In India, many people struggle to understand:
- What kind of health insurance suits their personal and financial situation
- Whether they are eligible for government health schemes
- The trade-offs between private insurance and public healthcare support

This confusion is especially common among **low-income families**, **young earners**, and **people with existing medical conditions**.  
Making the wrong insurance decision can lead to serious financial stress during medical emergencies.

## 💡 What We Built

MedCover-SocioAI is a simple, web-based tool that helps users make sense of healthcare options by:

- Collecting basic user details such as age, income, location, medical history, and dependents
- Analyzing this information in context instead of using rigid rules
- Suggesting **relevant health coverage options**, including:
  - Government health schemes
  - Private insurance plans
  - Hybrid approaches (e.g., employer-based coverage with add-ons)
- Clearly explaining **why each option is suggested** and what trade-offs the user should consider

The goal is **not to sell or recommend products**, but to help users **understand their options** and make informed decisions.

## 🤖 How Artificial Intelligence Is Used

Artificial Intelligence is used to:
- Interpret financial, medical, and household details together (not in isolation)
- Compare the user’s situation with common real-world healthcare scenarios
- Generate **explainable reasoning**, such as:
  - Why a government scheme may be more suitable
  - Why private insurance could be risky or expensive in certain cases
  - What limitations or risks the user should be aware of
- Power a **context-aware chatbot** that answers follow-up questions using previously provided details

Instead of fixed IF–ELSE rules, the system uses **contextual reasoning** to adapt its analysis based on the user’s profile.

## 🌍 Social Impact

- Improve awareness of public health schemes in India
- Help users avoid financially harmful insurance decisions
- Support individuals with chronic conditions or limited income
- Make healthcare information easier to understand without technical or medical jargon

MedCover-SocioAI is built around the principles of **accessibility, transparency, and AI for Social Impact**.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Limitations

- This tool **does not provide medical advice**
- It does **not replace official eligibility checks or professional consultation**
- No personal identifiers are permanently stored
- Final eligibility for any scheme depends on verification by official providers

The system is intended as a **decision-support and awareness tool**, not an authority.
